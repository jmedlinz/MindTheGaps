# MindTheGaps
Powershell script that analyzes a folder of time-based screenshots (for example, TimeSnapper) to report timespans worked and total hours worked.

This script was designed to work with folders like those created by the [TimeSnapper](http://www.timesnapper.com/) software application.  Timesnapper create a new folder each day, and as you work it stores screenshots of your work every few seconds.  This is useful for tracking what you worked on, and when, throughout your work day.

Although the tools and reporting from Timesnapper are excellent, manually analyzing the output into a summary for my notes each day was time consuming.  This script was created to automate it.

Example of output:  
```
9:44 am - 10:18 am : 0.6 hours (34 minutes)  
12:00 pm - 12:33 pm : 0.6 hours (33 minutes)  
12:55 pm - 1:53 pm : 1 hours (59 minutes)  
2:22 pm - 4:24 pm : 2 hours (122 minutes)  
Total worked: 4.1 hours (247 minutes)  
```
