# MindTheGaps

### MindTheGaps

Powershell scripts that analyzes a folder of time-based screenshots (for example, TimeSnapper) to report timespans worked and total hours worked.

This script was designed to work with folders like those created by the [TimeSnapper](http://www.timesnapper.com/) software application.  Timesnapper create a new folder each day, and as you work it stores screenshots of your work every few seconds.  This is useful for tracking what you worked on, and when, throughout your work day.

Although the tools and reporting from Timesnapper are excellent, manually analyzing the output into a summary for my notes each day was time consuming.  This script was created to automate it.

Example of output:  
```
9:44 am - 10:18 am : 0.6 hours (34 minutes)  
12:00 pm - 12:33 pm : 0.6 hours (33 minutes)  
12:55 pm - 1:53 pm : 1 hours (59 minutes)  
2:22 pm - 4:24 pm : 2 hours (122 minutes)  
Total worked: 4.1 hours (247 minutes)  
```

### FillTheGap
There are times when you are away from your desk and no files are generated by the time-tracking software but you may still be working - for example, when you are in meetings, reading, etc.  Instead of having to manually account for these times outside of the *MindTheGaps* script, an additional script can be used to easily fill in these gaps in your workday.  The *FillTheGap* script will create 'dummy' files usable by *MindTheGaps* but not TimeSnapper.

### ClearTheGap
Sometimes you may use some personal time, for example at lunch, to do some browsing or other activities that you don't want to use for *TimeTracker* or *MindTheGaps*.  *ClearTheGaps* will "clear" a block of time so it's not recognized by either application anymore.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Although it may not necessarily be a requirement, this script was designed and tested to work with folders created by the free version of the [TimeSnapper](http://www.timesnapper.com/) software application.
