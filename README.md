# MindTheGaps

### MindTheGaps

Powershell scripts that analyzes a folder of time-based screenshots (for example, TimeSnapper) to report timespans worked and total hours worked.

This script was designed to work with folders like those created by the [TimeSnapper](http://www.timesnapper.com/) software application.  Timesnapper create a new folder each day, and as you work it stores screenshots of your work every few seconds.  This is useful for tracking what you worked on, and when, throughout your work day.

Although the tools and reporting from Timesnapper are excellent, manually analyzing the output into a summary for my notes each day was time consuming.  This script was created to automate it.


Example usage:
```powershell
# Show the times worked and gaps for 3 days ago:
.\MindTheGaps.ps1 -3
```

Example of output:

![Example output of MindTheGaps](./mtg_example.png?raw=true "Example output of MindTheGaps")

By default the script will show gaps between the work sessions also.  This can be useful to track how long you're taking on breaks and other non-work activities.

### WeeklyGaps
Runs the *MindTheGaps* script for each day of the week and summarizes the results.  This script will also show the total hours worked for the week.
By default, gaps are not shown in the weekly summary.  This can be changed by with the `ShowGaps` variable.

Example usage:
```powershell
# Show the weekly report, including gaps, for last week:
 .\WeeklyGaps.ps1 -1 -ShowGaps
```

### FillTheGap
There are times when you are away from your desk and no files are generated by the time-tracking software but you may still be working - for example, when you are in meetings, reading, etc.  Instead of having to manually account for these times outside of the *MindTheGaps*
script, an additional script can be used to easily fill in these gaps in your workday.  The *FillTheGap* script will create 'dummy' files usable by *MindTheGaps* but not TimeSnapper.


Example usage:
```powershell
# Fill a gap from 10:15am to 10:30am for two days ago:
.\FillTheGap.ps1 10:15am 10:30am -2
```

### ClearTheGap
Sometimes you may use some personal time, for example at lunch, to do some browsing or other activities that you don't want to use for *TimeTracker* or *MindTheGaps*.  *ClearTheGaps* will "clear" a block of time so it's not recognized by either application anymore.

Example usage:
```powershell
# Clear the gap from 12:00pm to 1:00pm today:
.\ClearTheGap.ps1 12:00pm 1:00pm
```
